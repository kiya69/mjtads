Our professor points out that all these initiatives are from the western countries but I wonder if it’s because ai and technology are usually coming from the western world thus, the ethic topic comes along with them.
We do lack of views from other countries but I wonder what input will we get. but if we are just talking about the basic ethic priciples then it’ll be a way broader but interesting topic. For example, in indigenous people there are 5 genders, these are male, female, a male with a female spirit, a female with a male spirit, and a body with both spirits. So this is definitely not from the western or christian pov, and worth condsidering for ethics problems.</p>

<p>Another topic i like to talk about is gender inequality. For example, most cars are designed for men, and it’s not suitable for women, and if that’s the reason we have accident, the men laugh at us becuase we are “Women” so we don’t drive as good as them but they design it to fit their needs not ours. So who’s the wrong here?</p>

<p>All these questions lead me to think: who am i to determine how we should behave?</p>]]></content><author><name>Wan-Ting Chang</name></author><category term="beginner" /><category term="Ethical ai" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today we discuss the 6 initiatives for 5 principles in Ethical AI.
